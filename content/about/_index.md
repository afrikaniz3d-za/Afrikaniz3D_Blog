Worked in the built environment for a number of years after receiving a degree in architecture. This has more recently expanded to include  mechanical/hardsurface design and the generation of digital assets for sale, tying back to earlier aspirations of entering the game development field. This has since changed, and still changing to better align with some current personal interests.
