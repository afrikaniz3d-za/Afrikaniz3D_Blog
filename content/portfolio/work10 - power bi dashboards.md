This entry is related to South African energy exploration that on RStudio that you can look at [here](https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/data-explorations-using-r-studio/). My intentions for this segment of the exploration is to take the same data and generate some dashboards that you would find for up-to-date looks on some statistics - snapshots.
