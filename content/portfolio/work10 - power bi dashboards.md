![briefing][1]

This entry is related to South African energy exploration that on RStudio that you can look at [here](https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/data-explorations-using-r-studio/). My intentions for this segment of the exploration is to take the same data and generate some dashboards that you would find for up-to-date looks on some statistics - snapshots.

![step: uploading data to power bi][2]

![exporting the long data][3]

The first dataset I wanted to look at was the one containing the hourly measurements of the different sources of renewable energy from ESKOM ("zaregenlong") that was generated and exported from RStudio.

![initial report][4]

As with the plots generated in Rstudio, my long-held assumptions that solar was "king" are squashed. Before continuing any further I had a look at the locations of [South Africa's wind farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wind_farms_in_South_Africa) which are concentrated in the Northern, Western, and Eastern Capes. What makes this more interesting for me is the potential further maximize generation using recent technologies in wind energy harvesting such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnSZ0MHIcvs) example.
