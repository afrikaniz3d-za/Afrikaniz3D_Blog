<p>This was a client project I got some time back. The relationship with the client was a strange once, and it wouldn’t make sense to comment further as I think the whole experience itself was something else. I was no angel myself, but what I took away from it was a lot more than a new monitor.</p>

<p>The first piece - the receiver - was easily the hardest. The bug mistakes were:<br />
&gt; support loops in general<br />
&gt; not outlining the entire object first (planning ahead)<br />
&gt;</p>
