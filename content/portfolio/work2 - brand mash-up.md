The Brand Mash-Up series was one of the first bigger projects on my YouTube channel that I started as a means of both expanding on what I had been doing as well as learning new tools such as Blender. The idea for **BRAUBERRY** was a response to the need for being careful when handling intellectual properties I didn't own in the case they might endanger my YouTube channel. It was also a fun opportunity to see what could come about from merging two seemingly non-related brands.

### The BRAUBERRY Typeface

The first step I normally follow is the brand name/word and its typeface. I borrowed the grid technique used to create the original Braun logo and identity. The typeface was made more regular, taking most of its influences from Braun. I intentionally chose not to look at existing examples of Braun typefaces so as not to be too influenced when solving for symbols I had not yet seen. The grid I chose made some instances very difficult, but the result was some interesting letters and characters that I think made it uniquely **BRAUBERRY**.

One other exercise was the creation of the BRAUBERRY emblem/monogram. A Mirrored "B" was deemed simple and motif-friendly - something that was very common at the time for a lot of the big brands like LV and Gucci.

Once these elements were developed far enough to be used in scenes it was time to create first the product, the **Luda** cologne.

The idea for this product was inspired by a lyric from a Missy Elliot and Ludacris song that made reference to Burberry cologne. Looking at it now I see just how unfamiliar I was with Blender as most of the design was limited by what I could do. It would be interesting to see how I'd fare today..


### LUPA

The goal of this project was to combine some unrelated elements into a unique design. It took the bottle-top mechanism found on some brands of beer, adding it to the function of a backpack. The result was a strange-looking item that sported a houndstooth pattern - which was a callback to the name of the product.

The video I made for this project was one of my favourites and I'm sad it got lost during a time when I was becoming more familiar with the other parts of the systems and industries I was entering - it's difficult to look back at this time without some pause. I regret the things lost, but where I have gained I have managed to recapture some things I needed to motivate me to continue.

### Auroboros

![Auroboros][8]

The last project in the first Brand Mash-Up experiment was the Auroboros Bluetooth speaker. The name is a combination of "audio" and "ouroboros", with the form being a torus textured to look like the scales of a snake. The goal of this project was to explore the creation of a short advertisement. I was moderately successful when considering what I had set out to achieve, but, again, my limited experience with Blender and Da Vinci Resolve at the time shines through.

Overall I managed to achieve more than I expected during this project and, to this day, use some of these lessons in new projects. I do intend to revive **BRAUBERRY** and Brand Mash-Up when circumstances permit.
