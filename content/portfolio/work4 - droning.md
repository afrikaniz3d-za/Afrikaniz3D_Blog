2019 marked the first full year of AFRIKANIZ3D. I was still mostly working on architectural projects. I bought a drone, the first generation DJI Mini. The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed things "a bit" through various restrictions, but I'm happy that this gets to be part of the mix and look forward to seriously playing with it again.
