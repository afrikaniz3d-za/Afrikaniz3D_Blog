![january print designs][5]

Been wanting to experiment with something a little more complex by exploring the flatpack kit design by using the popular Pochita character from Chainsaw Man. The design process was mostly intuitive using some reference images, taking a few tries to get a result that looks best rather than working directly off of a sketch as it was difficult to draw the ideal view to work off of (lazy :D). Look forward to more of these moving forward.

Stuck to regular modeling for this set moving forward mostly for the cleaner wireframes. Any of the original models can be uploaded/set on request.

Second entry in the 3d printing exploration looked at workflows for creating the models. Normally would have gone with regular boolean and subdivision, but wanted to try find a quicker option. This ended up being going from blocking-out with booleans and then using the remesh modifier.  The topology was dense and close-up looks would show uneven surfaces, but the small scale made it less of an issue.

Users who've printed the models haven't mentioned running into any problems aside from the thiccness of some walls. This was an easy fix. File sizes were also relative to other previous prints

The first real exploration into 3D printing started with this soap dish you can download [here](https://afrikaniz3dza.gumroad.com/l/xyhdb). I share it out to some local groups and managed to get a few bites.

The picture above s an early test. I had gotten some feedback about the use of supports in the printing process, where others stated there might not be a need for them. Not sure if the forms chosen for the model played a part in the result, but this will also be looked into for the next submission.
