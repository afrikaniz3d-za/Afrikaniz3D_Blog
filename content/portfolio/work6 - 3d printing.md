![december print designs][4]

Stuck to regular modeling for this set moving forward mostly for the cleaner wireframes, but also to make it easier for anyone to edit the file before printing.

![assorted cutters][3]

Second entry in the 3d printing exploration looked at workflows for creating the models. Normally would have gone with regular boolean and subdivision, but wanted to try find a quicker option. This ended up being going from blocking-out with booleans and then using the remesh modifier.  The topology was dense and close-up looks would show uneven surfaces, but the small scale made it less of an issue.

Users who've printed the models haven't mentioned running into any problems aside from the thiccness of some walls. This was an easy fix. File sizes were also relative to other previous prints

The first real exploration into 3D printing started with this soap dish you can download [here](https://afrikaniz3dza.gumroad.com/l/xyhdb). I share it out to some local groups and managed to get a few bites.

![test print by ansie 1][2]

The picture above s an early test. I had gotten some feedback about the use of supports in the printing process, where others stated there might not be a need for them. Not sure if the forms chosen for the model played a part in the result, but this will also be looked into for the next submission.
