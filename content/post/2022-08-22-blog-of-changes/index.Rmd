Burnout isn't the only reason I stopped making artwork for a while. I also realised I'd been, for the longest time, guilty of only doing works that would be seen. Practice was meaningless if it would only be seen by me, if it wouldn't eventually be sent out to get hearts and likes. Sad, but mostly true. It's a weird thing to tackle, but the thing that helped me the most was to commit to daily routines of producing/exploring with the intent of doing the same thing better over time.

[...Brain fart] Time is a funny thing - in the non-comical sense.

Got a new (secondhand) monitor a few weeks ago. It's HOOJ. Slight yellow tint and some other quirks, but, man, it made me realise just how bad a place I was (mentally) working with a third of a smaller screen.

Been working to finish the project that made it possible. Focusing on that before I get back to other stuff, but I'm also enjoying the things I've been learning. 

Feels so good getting back to a place/pace where it feels like I'm getting back to an older self. Some changes ahead.
