![from me][1]

These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it's given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.

Letting go is something I've had to think a lot more lately in a variety of situations. What I discovered for myself is that it is not a simple act. It is also not tied to just negative experiences. I've been mentally workshopping a path to fully getting back on track, what it looks like and what I'd be doing to live and maintain it. I identified things within my own power that held me back, and the external factors I have to navigate around. 

It's been a concept I've narrowly understood (as with many,many things) for some time, and I hope to get better at the practice with time.


![for you][2]

[Here's](https://afrikaniz3dza.gumroad.com/l/xyhdb) a free .STL file. It's a soap dish.

Modeling items for 3D printing as a service is on the way. It's not much of a departure from what I've been building up already, and it's a great way to enter the  tangible product market rather than staying in digital spaces. I don't plan on getting a printer yet, but the practice will help and there's lots to learn.

If you decide to print the file please send me a pic of it or some feedback regarding any issues.
