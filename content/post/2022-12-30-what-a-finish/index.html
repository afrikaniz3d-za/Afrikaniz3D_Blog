<p>The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.</p>
<p>Started a “<strong><em>Prusa Printer Challenge</em></strong>” for myself in 2023&gt;&gt; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The <a href="https://www.printables.com/contest">contests</a> on <a href="https://www.printables.com/">Printables</a> are fun incentives to create - and be creative.</p>
<p>Finally took the time to update the theme of the site along with some other little features. Doesn’t really feel like 2022 is ending. Weather’s been sublime though.</p>

<p>Since it’s the festive season a lot of the pieces are Christmas-themed. All subdivision modeled cookie cutters that were entered into some contests. I also really like the engagement system on the site as well as the community. Will see how it goes. I’ve already seen some prints and look forward to printing my own at some point.</p>
