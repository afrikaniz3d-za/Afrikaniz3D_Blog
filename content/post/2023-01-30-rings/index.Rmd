![from me][1]  
Things are relatively quiet. Regular exercise and mindful eating. The Printer Challenge is still going along with the data exploration exercises. Happy with how the portfolio is shaping up.

This website is an example of something I look forward to looking back on in months (and years) to come and be able so see how it slowly solidified - like examining the rings of a tree trunk with the passage of time (after you chop it down...?...). 

Only focusing on what I can affect/change and doing my best to ignore the rest.
Happy 2023

![for you][2]  
The formula for the time being is: two simpler designs, and one that's a little more complex. You can read more about them in the portfolio entry [here](https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/3d-printing).
