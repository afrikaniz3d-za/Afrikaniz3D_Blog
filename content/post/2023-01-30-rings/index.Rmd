![from me][1]  
Putting together last month's post ended up being a lot more difficult than I had originally thought it would be. A look back at the year would include the successes and the failures, patterns that needed reinforcing or put to rest. I know the correct thing to say is that it was a trying, great year - and that's mostly true. The difficulty with the post, however, was that I hadn't trained myself (yet) to see what it was all developing into long-term, so I ended up having a narrower view and not ***really*** celebrating progress. Am I where I envisioned myself being by now? Nerp. Changes are still being made and will take time before the pay-off. Biggest task for the moment is getting more data exploration work done before I can get back to the fun mech stuff.

This website, for example, is something I look forward to looking back on in months (and years) to come and be able so see how it slowly solidified - like examining the rings of a tree trunk with the passage of time. 

God knows what this year holds, but I'm hoping I placed some good bets.  
  
Happy New Year

The formula for the time being is: two simpler designs, and one that's a little more complex. You can read more about them in the portfolio entry [here](https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/3d-printing).
