Putting together last month’s post ended up being a lot more difficult than I had originally thought it would be. A look back at the year would include the successes and the failures, patterns that needed reinforcing or put to rest. I know the correct thing to say is that it was a trying, great year - and that’s mostly true. The difficulty with the post, however, was that I hadn’t trained myself (yet) to see what it was all developing into long-term, so I ended up having a narrower view and not <strong><em>really</em></strong> celebrating progress. Am I where I envisioned myself being by now? Nerp. Changes are still being made and will take time before the pay-off. Biggest task for the moment is the career shift before I can get back fun mech stuff.</p>
<p>This website, for example, is something I look forward to looking back on in months (and years) to come and be able so see how it slowly solidified - like examining the rings of a tree trunk with the passage of time.</p>
<p>God knows what this year holds, but I’m hoping I placed some good bets.
Happy New Year</p>

The formula for the time being is: two simpler designs, and one that’s a little more complex. The first is a donut cookie mould, the second a desktop planter, and the last one is a flatpack kit of Pochita - I haven’t seen Chainsaw Man, but this character is trending too hard to ignore.</p>
