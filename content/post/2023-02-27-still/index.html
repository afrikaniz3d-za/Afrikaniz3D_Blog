Might just be the combination of things I’ve been focusing on lately, but finding a good fit is shifting more and more. So much changes in a month that the draft 2 weeks is so different to the draft of the night before. Found a way to make the data explorations more interesting while also getting to make new stuff as well as following through with older ideas. Nothing goes to waste. This will also let me get more content on <strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong>.</p>

The first project (wip) is <strong><em>Sensor 21</em></strong> based on an air quality survey. It was a short exploration that didn’t give much past learning new fixes, but the modeling aspect was a way to salvage the time spent and use it to move other pieces.</p>
<p>Started going through the <strong><em>Tidy Tuesday</em></strong> library of datasets, keeping in-mind the 3D component afterwards. I think this will scratch a lot of itches.</p>
