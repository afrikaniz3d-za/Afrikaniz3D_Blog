<p>Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I’m projecting as “acceptable” image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active.</p>
<p>But it also wasn’t the case of taking a social media break to reset. In fact, I think I’ve been more active online in the past 8 months. Taking stock of all my routines - planned, daily, the things in-between - and experimenting with taking breaks (even from activities/tasks that were necessary to advance in some areas) posed new and old questions, over and over and all over again.</p>
<p>The most annoying part about this all is that I started quietly (even to my waking self) figuring it out slowly and incrementally. I don’t want to make the old mistake on proclaiming I finally have it - because it isn’t something to have. It’s also a strange comfort to know that I won’t reach the point where I definitively do figure it out, but I’m certain working on it everyday offers the opportunity to discover a a way to do things better.</p>
