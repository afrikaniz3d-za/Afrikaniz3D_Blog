<p>[][1]</p>
<p>A while ago I learned about something called the “<a href="https://learningloop.io/plays/psychology/zeigarnik-effect#:~:text=The%20Zeigarnik%20Effect%20is%20a,dissonance%2C%20which%20improves%20recall%20ability."><strong>Zeigarnik Effect</strong></a>”, named after it’s creator Bluma Zeigarnik. I discovered it one of those inspirational-style posters while scrolling on Pinterest, and it came at a time where I must have been dealing some kind(s) of <em>stuckness</em> because of how much I resonated with the idea, having finally found a word I could hang the many things I was trying to juggle.</p>
<p>By then I was settled on “focusing on too many things at once” not being the issue. It had to become that way to preserve momentum. I needed to find a better system. To do that I first needed to understand what was not working with what I was already doing.</p>
<p>Keeping a work <strong><em>journal/planner</em></strong> was non-negotiable. I could write down all the things I wanted/needed to accomplish. Figuring out which category I was leaning toward wasn’t possible without jotting it all down. I found that I really was doing too much - at least if you’re looking at it from the perspective of a person with a fairly figured-out plan. What complicated things was that these things could be grouped into three separate people - a response/reaction i had after many sudden dead-ends in recent endeavours that resulted in either starting again or trying something else.</p>
<p>Adopting a back-to-school approach has really helped. It’s still very simplistic and the items for each day are basically identical - aside from the exercise routine for the day and the details for ongoing projects. Being able to look back through each notebook when it’s filled up is such a trip, and it’s a little scary to also see the downsides of relying on the routine too because I remember most things in relation to tasks that have essentially blurred days and weeks together through repetition.</p>
<p>Finding the right balance is becoming more of a conscious effort.</p>
<p>Had a wild week that started <em>Sunday 8 September</em> when I finally completed the turnaround render to add to the timelapse for the robotic arm project. I had put it off for some time. I was really happy with the design, the improved quality overall as well as just getting to the point where I could take it off the list. Impatience, though, let me to push my machine harder than it deserved and I ended up nearly bricking it trying to take advantage of the CUDA cores of my 8 year-old machine. Having decided I was getting everything for <a href="https://blendermarket.com/products/hexes-mini-pack-03?search_id=32766867"><strong>HMP03</strong></a> that week, I ignored the signs tat my machine was not going to be able to render out that nearly 7-hour timelapse, regardless of the settings. Sunday night I set up one final attempt to see how far it would go before crashing. Sleeping through the roaring CPU fan was a small price to pay, I thought. What I woke up to the next day was the start of maelstrom. Long story short (and simplified), my attempt to push performance resulted in throwing it out of sync and in a state where I couldn’t fix in a way I was sure wouldn’t reveal itself to have its own issues down-the-line.</p>
<p>Midweek, wanting to get back on track, I decided to format and re-install. That took it’s own time and I wanted to make sure I soaked enough of it in and also use the opportunity to clean up and simplify things where I can. The past few weeks had made it clear what I needed and worked with the most, so I could make sure I was setting up for the next calamity - because of course there’ll be more, but they’ll be easier to manage based on how I set things up now.</p>
<p>Friday, I’ve set back up again and so damn relieved that I decided to rather start the weekend early while also reflecting on how things got to where they were. It’s also funny how one of my last thoughts on Sunday night was to cancel that render and start a second round of editing on the timelapse to get it into a more manageable range for my machine, but noooooo.. “Just let it run and we will see tomorrow,” I thought.</p>
<p>I thought.</p>
<p>I’ve since started that new round of edits and there are improvements. It does set me back, preventing me from putting that energy into a new project instead, but something I resolved to do better in lately is to really follow the gut instinct and not rush for time - especially when it’s either something I know would be better or something I hadn’t done at a particular level before. Rushing for time betrays both those things, and it sucks looking back seeing so easily what could have been done to really make it te project I originally had in-mind.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve talked about this before, but it’s clearly something I need to constantly work through till it sticks - and I’m not resisting it anymore because I’ve seen the results.</p>
<p>With so much going on, building up stamina/will(power) is something I’m looking to get into more of. Multi-tasking 3D work and Data education/portfolio building isn’t ideal, but it’s been necessary and I’m hoping it pays off soon.</p>
<p>The process has had its own comforts.</p>
