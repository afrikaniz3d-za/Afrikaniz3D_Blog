      <title>Healthier Candy Choices for the Maven Halloween Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W11/w11001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I already had an angle for where I wanted to take this project prior to looking at the data. The goal was to prioritize choosing the the healthier options coupled with them being the most popular according to respondent feedback - really simple, to the point where there were times I felt I was doing a disservice to the project and the data. I always find something an any EDA I do that has little to do with the outlined question but is still significant in some way. In this particular project I found that there were a number of name/ownership changes and some treats were even discontinued. This was possible because a lot of the work for this project happened outside the table due to the need for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lobbyists 4 America</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of getting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL for Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; certification, I was required to complete a capstone project. I chose the Lobbyists 4 America project. The project was done on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.cloud.databricks.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;Databricks&lt;/strong&gt; platform. I used both SQL and Python to carry out the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below is the full notebook for my project:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe id=&#34;l4a-notebook&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/notebooks/N12/n12.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;600px&#34; style=&#34;border:none;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick=&#34;toggleFullScreen()&#34;&gt;View Fullscreen&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;script&gt;&#xA;function toggleFullScreen() {&#xA;    var iframe = document.getElementById(&#34;l4a-notebook&#34;);&#xA;    if (iframe.requestFullscreen) {&#xA;        iframe.requestFullscreen();&#xA;    } else if (iframe.mozRequestFullScreen) { // Firefox&#xA;        iframe.mozRequestFullScreen();&#xA;    } else if (iframe.webkitRequestFullscreen) { // Chrome, Safari and Opera&#xA;        iframe.webkitRequestFullscreen();&#xA;    } else if (iframe.msRequestFullscreen) { // IE/Edge&#xA;        iframe.msRequestFullscreen();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/script&gt;  &#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I covered a lot of new areas in this project, including having to use machine learning to work with subjective data. It also gave me some insight into how social media is used to shape thought and perception as well as how some of the strategies employed aren&amp;rsquo;t as direct/obvious as one would assume. On top of that, it also helps to explain some of the decisions made by social networks (like Twitter) sometimes change how algorithms work and why some of those changes aren&amp;rsquo;t shared wit the public/creators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Maven Hospital Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took part in this year&amp;rsquo;s Maven Hospital Challenge. I used Databrick&amp;rsquo;s Community Edition. The exploration was mostly SQL-based. I opted for Databricks over Big Query for the ability to upload large files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I completed the exploration in time I chose to opt out of submitting because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a dashboard solution at the time that I was happy with. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning Shiny. It suits my set-up and I have a lot of the infrastructure already that makes it easy to work offline when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8009.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This EDA was inspired by a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidy Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a client project I got some time back. The relationship with the client was a strange once, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to comment further as I think the whole experience itself was something else. I was no angel myself, but what I took away from it was a lot more than a new monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W13/w13001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first piece - the receiver - was easily the hardest. The big mistakes were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The data being explored relates to South African energy, primarily electricity. This exercise will be replicated on other tools later on such as Power BI and SQL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The datasets are mostly in .csv format and were collected from the following sources:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://https://www.eskom.co.za/dataportal/renewables-performance/&#34;&gt;Eskom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.worldbank.org&#34;&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://energydata.info&#34;&gt;Energy Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rise.esmap.org&#34;&gt;Regulatory Indicator for Sustainable Energy (RISE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://energy.gov.za&#34;&gt;South African Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
