         <h1>BRAUBERRY [Brand Mash-Up Project]</h1>
         <p>The Brand Mash-Up series was one of the first bigger projects on my YouTube channel that I started as a means of both expanding on what I had been doing as well as learning new tools such as Blender. The idea for <strong>BRAUBERRY</strong> was a response to the need for being careful when handling intellectual properties I didn&rsquo;t own in the case they might endanger my YouTube channel. It was also a fun opportunity to see what could come about from merging two seemingly non-related brands.</p>
<h3 id="the-brauberry-typeface">The BRAUBERRY Typeface</h3>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2001.gif" alt="BRAUBERRY typeface"></p>
<p>The first step I normally follow is the brand name/word and its typeface. I borrowed the grid technique used to create the original Braun logo and identity. The typeface was made more regular, taking most of its influences from Braun. I intentionally chose not to look at existing examples of Braun typefaces so as not to be too influenced when solving for symbols I had not yet seen. The grid I chose made some instances very difficult, but the result was some interesting letters and characters that I think made it uniquely <strong>BRAUBERRY</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2002.gif" alt="BRAUBERRY Monogram"></p>
<p>One other exercise was the creation of the BRAUBERRY emblem/monogram. A Mirrored &ldquo;B&rdquo; was deemed simple and motif-friendly - something that was very common at the time for a lot of the big brands like LV and Gucci.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2003.gif" alt="BRAUBERRY Monogram Motif"></p>
<p>Once these elements were developed far enough to be used in scenes it was time to create first the product, the <strong>Luda</strong> cologne.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2004.png" alt="LUDA 1"></p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2005.png" alt="LUDA 2"></p>
<p>The idea for this product was inspired by a lyric from a Missy Elliot and Ludacris song that made reference to Burberry cologne. Looking at it now I see just how unfamiliar I was with Blender as most of the design was limited by what I could do. It would be interesting to see how I&rsquo;d fare today..</p>
<h3 id="lupa">LUPA</h3>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2006.png" alt="Lupa Pack"></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to combine some unrelated elements into a unique design. It took the bottle-top mechanism found on some brands of beer, adding it to the function of a backpack. The result was a strange-looking item that sported a houndstooth pattern - which was a callback to the name of the product.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2007.gif" alt="LUPA Options"></p>
<p>The video I made for this project was one of my favourites and I&rsquo;m sad it got lost during a time when I was becoming more familiar with the other parts of the systems and industries I was entering - it&rsquo;s difficult to look back at this time without some pause. I regret the things lost, but where I have gained I have managed to recapture some things I needed to motivate me to continue.</p>
<h3 id="auroboros">Auroboros</h3>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2008.jpg" alt="Auroboros"></p>
<p>The last project in the first Brand Mash-Up experiment was the Auroboros Bluetooth speaker. The name is a combination of &ldquo;audio&rdquo; and &ldquo;ouroboros&rdquo;, with the form being a torus textured to look like the scales of a snake. The goal of this project was to explore the creation of a short advertisement. I was moderately successful when considering what I had set out to achieve, but, again, my limited experience with Blender and Da Vinci Resolve at the time shines through.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/W2/w2009.gif" alt="Colour options"></p>
<p>Overall I managed to achieve more than I expected during this project and, to this day, use some of these lessons in new projects. I do intend to revive <strong>BRAUBERRY</strong> and Brand Mash-Up when circumstances permit.</p>
