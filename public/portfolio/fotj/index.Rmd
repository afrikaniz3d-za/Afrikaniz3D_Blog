This project came about during session working on the [**M4**](https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/retopologizing-m4/) retopo commission. There were many instances where I'd be zoomed-in working on a particular section for some time that started looking like the beginnings of other objects - like hallways, or a funky mechanical part.  

I sat on the idea for a while till I could find the "*right*" polygons to build from..

I was working on the **flywheel housing** for [**MDP**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLryiPmQj99uABWE4-p4GGluo2kxhR5KWT) and selected a circular section with some stray polys. At the time I wasn't sold on the final result, but I knew it was another case of "give it time".  

What started as each FOTJ "chapter" comprising of one polygon basemesh, chapter 3 started with, well, 3 :D.  

Earlier on, I found that I could take these pieces and extract further models that had the added benefit of visually still relating to the main pieces - making kitbashing projects easier when looking for variation. I wanted to know how far/wide it could branch if I started with 3 models instead of just one.

**FOTJ 030101** (above) was what came about when I got stuck, I decided to strip the stripped pieces even further down and organise them into a mass before connecting them bit-by-bit. There are still elements that link it to the source, but there's a newness to it that cleared the blockage I had.  

So, what can you do with these models?
