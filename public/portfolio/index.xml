      <description>The Brand Mash-Up series was one of the first bigger projects on my YouTube channel that I started as a means of both expanding on what I had been doing as well as learning new tools such as Blender. The idea for BRAUBERRY was a response to the need for being careful when handling intellectual properties I didn&amp;rsquo;t own in the case they might endanger my YouTube channel. It was also a fun opportunity to see what could come about from merging two seemingly non-related brands.</description>

      <description>Forming a clear picture of the path to take towards a goal, something I am relearning, is affected by a variety of things, chief of which being that I find it difficult to push through a contrived/inauthentic path. Testing authenticity, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, has universally championed rubrics I&amp;rsquo;ll undoubtedly discover ahead now that the idea has been “committed to the bits.” How this ties to this project are the motivations that punctuated its creation.</description>

More cookie cutters - those will be a staple. Looking to get better at making flatpack designs. The Pochita design is picking up in terms of downloads and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get improve in the overall quality - down to the supports. This ended up with a cat design that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, but did give an idea for something simpler.
What this project told me is that I need t o learn to sculpt soon to get the most out of any kind of services I could offer in the space.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this data exploration is to apply and the practice the skills gained from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. The data being explored relates to South African energy, primarily electricity. This exercise will be replicated on other tools later on such as Power BI and SQL.
The datasets are mostly in .csv format and were collected from the following sources:
Eskom
World Bank
Energy Data
Regulatory Indicator for Sustainable Energy (RISE)</description>

      <description>2019 marked the first full year of AFRIKANIZ3D. I was still mostly working on architectural projects. I bought a drone, the first generation DJI Mini. The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed things &amp;ldquo;a bit&amp;rdquo; through various restrictions, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy that this gets to be part of the mix and look forward to seriously playing with it again.</description>

      <description>This entry is related to South African energy exploration that on RStudio that you can look at here. My intentions for this segment of the exploration is to take the same data and generate some dashboards that you would find for up-to-date looks on some statistics - snapshots.
The dataset I wanted to look at was the one containing the hourly measurements of the different sources of renewable energy from ESKOM (&amp;ldquo;zaregenlong&amp;rdquo;) that was generated and exported from RStudio.</description>
