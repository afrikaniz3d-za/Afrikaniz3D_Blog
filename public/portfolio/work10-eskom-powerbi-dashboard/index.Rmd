![The Goal][2]  

xx  

&nbsp;  

#### 1.1 Understanding what a Moneyball is  

Prior to this project I had no concept of what a moneyball was, guessing that it may be related somehow to a type of lottery or gameshow. Looking into this first would help provide some guardrails for navigating the data.    

My  

&nbsp;  

#### 1.2 Create a mutant selection aid  

Because situations where moneyballs are normally performed involve...
This isn't a simple task when you're looking at a table with big numbers, so transforming that into a visual form that reduces the mental calculations using four input devices will make the exploration easier and more engaging.  

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;   

![The Process][3]  

After importing the dataset into **MySQL**, I performed transform the data into a form that was easier to read and connect with as someone that was familiar with the franchise. 

#### 2.1 Data transformation in MySQL  

xx

&nbsp;  

#### 2.2 Making the data easier to read  

This included introducing each mutants "identity" name in a new column to accompany the. I think this makes the data a little more accessible to people with a passing familiarity  

&nbsp;  

#### 2.3 Importing cleaned data into RStudio for visualization  

With the table cleaned, visualisation is the next step. Recently I've been making Quarto-friendly [templates](https://github.com/afrikaniz3d-za/Quarto-Ready-ECharts4R-Templates) for ECharts4R and posting one weekly as a way of sharing what I learn, and a form of accountability. A benefit of this (and the timing) is that I had a radar chart template ready to be adapted

![Insights][4]  

xx  

#### 3.x The 70s were the height of popularity  

![][]

The highest concentration of revenue is in this decade, and it also marks the beginning of a decline for most mutants.  

&nbsp;  

#### 3.x The [ Total Value x PPI ] Inversion  

Something the visualisation does a nice job of pointing out is that a mutant having a relatively high **total_value** can have a lower **ppi** (price per issue) by comparison to another mutant, and vice versa.  

![][]  

This information can be useful in a multi-round situation where you're either selecting for a **total_value** that's not-so-high across the four outlets, but the **ppi** sits well above average - making it a good pick in **ppi** face-offs.  

&nbsp;  

#### 3.x The extent of the Inversion  

I was interested in seeing how prevalent this relationship is. One way to explore this was using the tool itself to read the graphs, jotting down the results, but I wanted to see if I could do this by plotting a graph to see if there really was a **correlation** between the two metrics.  

Stated more concisely, I was asking,  
> "In a given decade and given outlet: If mutant A has a **higher total_value** than mutant B, is mutant A **more likely** to have a **lower price-per-issue** than mutant B?"  

To answer that question, the task was divided into two  parts:  

- Establishing whether the relationship really existed  
- Calculating the pairwise inversion rate  

&nbsp;  

##### 3.x.x Computing Spearman correlations with Sparklyr    



##### 3.x.x Creating the plot  

![single line chart showing inversion percentage over the decades][]  

Overall, the inversion exists ~20–30% of the time when looking at a single line chart, so I looked at segmenting it by outlet to see if my observation may have been more specific to any in particular.  

![segmented line chart showing inversion percentages across the four outlets over the decades][]  

The inversion between total_value dominance and per-issue pricing is *not uniform* across outlets. It is **most persistent** in **Wizard**, weakens over time in Ebay, and remains relatively stable elsewhere — indicating outlet-specific pricing mechanics rather than a universal market inefficiency.

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  

![Recommendations][5]  

Rather than looking at the **Mutant Stats Viewer** as a tool for making picks for a moneyball, I think it should rather be seen as a means for questioning potential "match-ups" chosen mutants may be involved in to see how they might fair under different conditions.  

The more you tinker with it the higher the likelihood you may discover more patterns as I have with the common inverse relationship between the total revenue versus price-per-issue for each mutant across decades.

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;   

![Reflections on the project][6]  

My approach going into this project was to look at this as an opportunity to see how far I could push my visualizations. There was a plan to make custom icons hat would appear when the corresponding mutant was selected, giving it a video game character selector look, but I had greatly underestimated the mechanics needed to..
