         <h1>Out of Time</h1>
         <p><img src="/img/post/P11/p11001.jpg" alt=""><br>
 </p>
<p>A while ago I learned about something called the &ldquo;<a href="https://learningloop.io/plays/psychology/zeigarnik-effect#:~:text=The%20Zeigarnik%20Effect%20is%20a,dissonance%2C%20which%20improves%20recall%20ability."><strong>Zeigarnik Effect</strong></a>&rdquo;, named after it&rsquo;s creator Bluma Zeigarnik. I discovered it in the form of one of those inspirational-style posters while scrolling on Pinterest, and it came at a time where I was dealing some kind(s) of <em>stuckness</em> because of how much I resonated with the idea. I&rsquo;d found a word to relate to the feeling. I like to think about it as a kind of blockage comprised of everything set in motion, or tripping over boxes I&rsquo;ve placed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with it later&rdquo; invisibility cloaks to visually &ldquo;declutter&rdquo; a space. Out of sight, out of mind - but they&rsquo;re still in the way.</p>
<p>Had a wild week that started <em>Sunday 8 September</em> when I finally completed the turnaround render to add to the timelapse for the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3EqyeJ"><strong>Robotic Arm</strong></a> project. Put it off for some time. I was really happy with the design and the improved quality overall. Impatience, though, let me to push my machine harder than it deserved and I ended up nearly bricking the motherboard of my 8 year-old machine. Having decided I was getting everything for <a href="https://blendermarket.com/products/hexes-mini-pack-03?search_id=32766867"><strong>HMP03</strong></a> that week, I ignored the signs that my machine was not going to be able to render out that nearly 7-hour timelapse, regardless of the settings.</p>
<p>Sunday night, I set up one final attempt to see how far it would go before crashing. Sleeping through the roaring CPU fan was a small price to pay, I thought. What I woke up to the next day was the start of a unpleasant detour. The nature of the issue made it difficult for me to resolve without having to format and re-install.</p>
<p>Midweek, wanting to get back on track, I decided to reset. That took it&rsquo;s own time and I wanted to make sure I soaked enough of it in and also use the opportunity to clean up and simplify things where I could. Applied this to many other areas too. The past few weeks had made it clear what I needed and worked with the most, so I could make sure I was only setting up for that.</p>
<p>Thursday, I&rsquo;ve set back up again and so damn relieved that I decided to start the weekend early while also reflecting on how things got to where they were. It&rsquo;s also funny how one of my last thoughts on Sunday night was to cancel that render and start a second round of editing on the timelapse to get it into a more manageable range for my machine, but noooooo.. &ldquo;Just let it run and we will see tomorrow,&rdquo; I thought.</p>
<p>I thought.</p>
<p>I did edits and there were improvements. It did set me back, preventing me from putting that energy into a new project instead, but something I resolved to do better in lately is listening the gut instinct and not rush for time - especially when it&rsquo;s either something I know would be better or something I hadn&rsquo;t done at a particular level before. Rushing for time betrays both those things, and it sucks looking back seeing so easily what could have been done to really make it the project I originally had in-mind.<br>
I feel like I&rsquo;ve talked about this before, but it&rsquo;s clearly something I need to constantly work through till it sticks - and I&rsquo;m not resisting it anymore because I&rsquo;ve seen the results.</p>
<p>The machine I&rsquo;m using is old, approaching a decade, and one of the things that comes with that is having components fail. I went from 12 gigs to 8. This impacted performance and there were things that I wrote off - even streaming had recently taken a hit. One really cool thing that came from the recent reset was learning what a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-swap-file-on-Linux-Mint#:~:text=Swap%20space%20in%20Linux%20is,a%20replacement%20for%20more%20RAM."><strong>swap file</strong></a> is. I explained my performance issues to Chat GPT and one of it&rsquo;s suggestions to improve performance was increasing the size of my system&rsquo;s swap file - something I&rsquo;d never heard of before. I checked what it was set to and realised why my machine was running the way it used to (even with only 8 gigs of RAM). I created a bigger one and everything is running sooo much better now. Glad I can take new cards off the wishlist.</p>
<p>Reworking the timelapse is something I&rsquo;m really glad I did. Realised today that I was kinda doing it already with those WIP vertical shorts I posted to social media, and I think it&rsquo;s the first step toward finding different/better format too. It will feel really good to properly close the loop on these projects and start a new batch.<br>

<p>Started working on a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLryiPmQj99uAzws5dLiyAOk3oMtAU70BK"><strong>FOTJ</strong></a> chapter and I tried working with multiple variations at the start. I&rsquo;ll add more as I&rsquo;m working on a new demo project.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the pieces I&rsquo;m currently working on. The base geometry was taken from the <a href="https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/portfolio/retopologizing-m4/"><strong>M4</strong></a> retopology project. There are a few sections that I felt would make interesting starting points, and I decided to explore more than one this time.</p>

It&rsquo;s not finished yet, so I&rsquo;ll probably ave it ready for the next post when I&rsquo;ve hopefully also finished the other two pieces and the video.
