      <description>from me
The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.
Started a “Prusa Printer Challenge” for myself in 2023&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The contests on Printables are fun incentives to create - and be creative.</description>

      <description>A year ago I created the Nutvember kitbashing set of nuts and bolts to&amp;hellip; celebrate(?) No Nut November (NNN). Also known as Movember it was something I&amp;rsquo;d been casually familiar with and I wanted to change that.
Read some papers, some very old and others recent. Masturbation is what I read the most on because I wanted to find conversations on the act that weren&amp;rsquo;t focused on the psycho-sexual parts explored by the Freuds or the Kinseys.</description>

      <description>These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.</description>

      <description>Getting the Ball RollingOne of the things I got out of completing the Data Analytics certification was being introduced to R and RStudio. I’ve since learned how to build a site using RStudio. This is the result so far and I’m currently filling it out daily till I get it to a level of completeness that covers what I can display.
The Learning ProcessEarly on I was fortunate enough to find CradleToGraveR’s channel on YouTube where he does an amazing job at walking you through the steps and also showing you other routes in case you run into some trouble - which I did on many occasions.</description>
