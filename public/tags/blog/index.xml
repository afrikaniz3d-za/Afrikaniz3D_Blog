      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P13/p13001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I slowed down on the job searching last year after 100s of applications and seeing posts from creators like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/jim.chuong/?hl=en&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Chuong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When you also have to deal with things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/30/ghost-jobs-why-do-40-of-companies-advertise-positions-that-dont-exist&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ghost job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; postings, and some instances of postings being for something else altogether, You really do need a different strategy when networking isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy and it&amp;rsquo;s an industry you&amp;rsquo;re fairly new in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is now the sixth year I&amp;rsquo;ve been a creator posting to social media. Although the bulk of that has been as a 3D designer, I&amp;rsquo;m slowly finding gaps for me to marry the two so that the codeswitch doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel as jarring. I alluded to this in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/post/walk/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-load-theory&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Load Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/#:~:text=Neuroplasticity%2C%20also%20known%20as%20neural,functional%20changes%20to%20the%20brain&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroplasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It really explains why I got so little else done on the days I set aside to work on data projects - the brain was tapped-out. A lot of it, I think, was also related to me still trying to wrap my head around the new problems coupled with starting with templates that were too complicated for someone unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Walk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P12/p12001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started writing this post at the end of October, last year, with the intent to do little entries leading up to the year&amp;rsquo;s close. Reading through it all, I can tell I was tired - in all the ways. The main takeaway from those five entries is that all of the projects discussed are &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; ongoing (and had been for a while), but the process was feeding and bleeding into each one in a &lt;em&gt;batchy&lt;/em&gt; kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Figuring it out again</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2024-08-12-been-busy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P10/p10001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I&amp;rsquo;m projecting an &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo; image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it also wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case of taking a social media break to reset. In fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been more active online in the past 8 months. Taking stock of all my routines - planned, daily, the things in-between - and experimenting with taking breaks (even when I needed to soldier through it) posed new and old questions, over and over, and all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P8/p8001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Might just be the combination of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on lately, but finding a good fit is shifting more and more. So much changes in a month that the draft 2 weeks is so different to the draft of the night before. Found a way to make the data explorations more interesting while also getting to make new stuff as well as following through with older ideas. Nothing goes to waste. This will also let me get more content on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Printer Challenge is still going along with the data exploration exercises. Happy with how the portfolio is shaping up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This website is an example of something I look forward to looking back on in months (and years) to come and be able so see how it slowly solidified - like examining the rings of a tree trunk with the passage of time (after you chop it down&amp;hellip;?&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What a Finish</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P6/p6001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&#xA;The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prusa Printer Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; for myself in 2023&amp;raquo; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.printables.com/contest&#34;&gt;contests&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.printables.com/&#34;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt; are fun incentives to create - and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P5/p5001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I created the Nutvember kitbashing set of nuts and bolts to&amp;hellip; celebrate(?) No Nut November (NNN). Also known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://movember.com&#34;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt; it was something I&amp;rsquo;d been casually familiar with and I wanted to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read some papers, some very old and others recent. Masturbation is what I read the most on because I wanted to find conversations on the act that weren&amp;rsquo;t focused on the psycho-sexual parts explored by the Freuds or the Kinseys. It ultimately came down to education, conventional and/or specifically sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letting Go?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2022-10-31-letting-go/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P4/p4001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
