      <description>Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I’m projecting as “acceptable” image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active.&#xA;But it also wasn’t the case of taking a social media break to reset.</description>

      <description>Might just be the combination of things I’ve been focusing on lately, but finding a good fit is shifting more and more. So much changes in a month that the draft 2 weeks is so different to the draft of the night before. Found a way to make the data explorations more interesting while also getting to make new stuff as well as following through with older ideas. Nothing goes to waste.</description>

      <description>Things are relatively quiet. Regular exercise and mindful eating. The Printer Challenge is still going along with the data exploration exercises. Happy with how the portfolio is shaping up.&#xA;This website is an example of something I look forward to looking back on in months (and years) to come and be able so see how it slowly solidified - like examining the rings of a tree trunk with the passage of time (after you chop it down…?</description>

      <description>The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.&#xA;Started a &amp;ldquo;Prusa Printer Challenge&amp;rdquo; for myself in 2023&amp;raquo; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The contests on Printables are fun incentives to create - and be creative.</description>

      <description>A year ago I created the Nutvember kitbashing set of nuts and bolts to&amp;hellip; celebrate(?) No Nut November (NNN). Also known as Movember it was something I&amp;rsquo;d been casually familiar with and I wanted to change that.&#xA;Read some papers, some very old and others recent. Masturbation is what I read the most on because I wanted to find conversations on the act that weren&amp;rsquo;t focused on the psycho-sexual parts explored by the Freuds or the Kinseys.</description>

      <title>Letting Go?</title>

      <description>These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.</description>
