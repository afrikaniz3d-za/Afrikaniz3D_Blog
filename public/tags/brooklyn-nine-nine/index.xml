      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P4/p4001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
