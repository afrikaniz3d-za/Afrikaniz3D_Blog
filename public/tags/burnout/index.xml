      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P2/p1001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burnout isn&amp;rsquo;t the only reason I stopped making artwork for a while. I also realised I&amp;rsquo;d been, for the longest time, guilty of only doing works that would be seen. Practice was meaningless if it would only be seen by me, if it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t eventually be sent out to get hearts and likes. Sad, but mostly true. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird thing to tackle, but the thing that helped me the most was to commit to daily routines of producing/exploring with the intent of doing the same thing better over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
