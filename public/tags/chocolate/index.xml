      <description>&lt;p&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W11/w11001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I already had an angle for where I wanted to take this project prior to looking at the data. The goal was to prioritize choosing the the healthier options coupled with them being the most popular according to respondent feedback - really simple, to the point where there were times I felt I was doing a disservice to the project and the data. I always find something an any EDA I do that has little to do with the outlined question but is still significant in some way. In this particular project I found that there were a number of name/ownership changes and some treats were even discontinued. This was possible because a lot of the work for this project happened outside the table due to the need for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8009.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This EDA was inspired by a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidy Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
