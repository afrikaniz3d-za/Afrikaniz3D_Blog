I was no angel myself, but what I took away from it was a lot more than a new monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/portfolio/W13/w13001.webp&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first piece - the receiver - was easily the hardest. The big mistakes were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
