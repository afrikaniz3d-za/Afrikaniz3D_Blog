      <description>This EDA was inspired by a Tidy Tuesday dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&#xA;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.</description>
