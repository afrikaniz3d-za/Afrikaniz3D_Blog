      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took part in this year&amp;rsquo;s Maven Hospital Challenge. I used Databrick&amp;rsquo;s Community Edition. The exploration was mostly SQL-based. I opted for Databricks over Big Query for the ability to upload large files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I completed the exploration in time I chose to opt out of submitting because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a dashboard solution at the time that I was happy with. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning Shiny. It suits my set-up and I have a lot of the infrastructure already that makes it easy to work offline when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8001.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/portfolio/W8/w8009.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This EDA was inspired by a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidy Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
