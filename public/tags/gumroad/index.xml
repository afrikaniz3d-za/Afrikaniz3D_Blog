      <description>Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I’m projecting an “acceptable” image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active etc.&#xA;But it also wasn’t the case of taking a social media break to reset.</description>

      <description>I got to learn my modest way around geometry nodes while developing HEXES Mini Pack 04: Electronic Devices. I started work on it in January and was having trouble deciding how many to produce and the style to make them in. Using geonodes made it feel more flexible and user-friendly. The first project was Sensor 21, based on an air quality dataset I explored for a portfolio project.&#xA;Made a walkthrough video to show my process for the antenna.</description>

      <description>Might just be the combination of things I’ve been focusing on lately, but finding a good fit is shifting more and more. So much changes in a month that the draft 2 weeks is so different to the draft of the night before. Found a way to make the data explorations more interesting while also getting to make new stuff as well as following through with older ideas. Nothing goes to waste.</description>

      <description>The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.&#xA;Started a &amp;ldquo;Prusa Printer Challenge&amp;rdquo; for myself in 2023&amp;raquo; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The contests on Printables are fun incentives to create - and be creative.</description>
