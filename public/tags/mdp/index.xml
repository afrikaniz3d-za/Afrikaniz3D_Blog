      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/post/P10/p10001.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I’m projecting an “acceptable” image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it also wasn’t the case of taking a social media break to reset. In fact, I think I’ve been more active online in the past 8 months. Taking stock of all my routines - planned, daily, the things in-between - and experimenting with taking breaks (even when I needed to soldier through it) posed new and old questions, over and over, and all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
