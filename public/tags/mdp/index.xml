      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P10/p10001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I&amp;rsquo;m projecting an &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo; image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it also wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case of taking a social media break to reset. In fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been more active online in the past 8 months. Taking stock of all my routines - planned, daily, the things in-between - and experimenting with taking breaks (even when I needed to soldier through it) posed new and old questions, over and over, and all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
