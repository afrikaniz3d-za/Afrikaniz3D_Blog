      <description>This EDA was inspired by a Tidy Tuesday dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&#xA;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.</description>

      <description>Burnout isn&amp;rsquo;t the only reason I stopped making artwork for a while. I also realised I&amp;rsquo;d been, for the longest time, guilty of only doing works that would be seen. Practice was meaningless if it would only be seen by me, if it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t eventually be sent out to get hearts and likes. Sad, but mostly true. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird thing to tackle, but the thing that helped me the most was to commit to daily routines of producing/exploring with the intent of doing the same thing better over time.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this data exploration is to apply and the practice the skills gained from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. The data being explored relates to South African energy, primarily electricity. This exercise will be replicated on other tools later on such as Power BI and SQL.&#xA;The datasets are mostly in .csv format and were collected from the following sources:&#xA;Eskom&#xA;World Bank&#xA;Energy Data&#xA;Regulatory Indicator for Sustainable Energy (RISE)</description>
