      <description>Burnout isn’t the only reason I stopped making artwork for a while. I also realised I’d been, for the longest time, guilty of only doing works that would be seen. Practice was meaningless if it would only be seen by me, if it wouldn’t eventually be sent out to get hearts and likes. Sad, but mostly true. It’s a weird thing to tackle, but the thing that helped me the most was to commit to daily routines of producing/exploring with the intent of doing the same thing better over time.</description>
