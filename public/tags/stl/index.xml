      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/post/P5/p5001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I created the Nutvember kitbashing set of nuts and bolts to&amp;hellip; celebrate(?) No Nut November (NNN). Also known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://movember.com&#34;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt; it was something I&amp;rsquo;d been casually familiar with and I wanted to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read some papers, some very old and others recent. Masturbation is what I read the most on because I wanted to find conversations on the act that weren&amp;rsquo;t focused on the psycho-sexual parts explored by the Freuds or the Kinseys. It ultimately came down to education, conventional and/or specifically sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letting Go?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/post/P4/p4001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
