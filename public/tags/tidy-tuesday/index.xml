      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/portfolio/W8/w8001.webp&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/portfolio/W8/w8009.webp&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This EDA was inspired by a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tidy Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dataset that looked at the ratings of different cacao been suppliers in different countries. Rather than following the original data challenge, I decided to instead focus on the elements that dealt with South Africa (SA) because my first real look at the data showed that SA had received the lowest ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical challenge I set for myself was to use the data to identify what led to the poor ratings as well as what changes would need to be made to improve future results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afrikaniz3d.netlify.app/img/post/P8/p8001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Might just be the combination of things I’ve been focusing on lately, but finding a good fit is shifting more and more. So much changes in a month that the draft 2 weeks is so different to the draft of the night before. Found a way to make the data explorations more interesting while also getting to make new stuff as well as following through with older ideas. Nothing goes to waste. This will also let me get more content on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
