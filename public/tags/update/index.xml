      <description>from me
The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.
Started a “Prusa Printer Challenge” for myself in 2023&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The contests on Printables are fun incentives to create - and be creative.</description>

      <title>Letting Go?</title>

      <description>These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.</description>
