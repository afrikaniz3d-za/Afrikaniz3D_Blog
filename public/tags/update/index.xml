      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P10/p10001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been a while since I made a blog post having pulled back for a variety of reasons. Even as I was creating this entry it occurred to me again how draining and contrived it felt to concept these things and practice restraint, make sure I&amp;rsquo;m projecting an &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo; image, create and upload free models to link and keep the analytics active etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it also wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case of taking a social media break to reset. In fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been more active online in the past 8 months. Taking stock of all my routines - planned, daily, the things in-between - and experimenting with taking breaks (even when I needed to soldier through it) posed new and old questions, over and over, and all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What a Finish</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P6/p6001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&#xA;The past few days really drove home how much of a break I need. That coupled with the growing pains of using Linux was what really shifted the last two months by a few gears. It did, though, have surprising benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prusa Printer Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; for myself in 2023&amp;raquo; as a way of turning free content into a new tool for the business. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.printables.com/contest&#34;&gt;contests&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.printables.com/&#34;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt; are fun incentives to create - and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letting Go?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/post/2022-10-31-letting-go/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/img/post/P4/p4001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;from me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These blog posts started out with the purpose of covering what I thought were things worth sharing and, in a sense, backing-up some experiences to revisit. The episode where Terry (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) resolves to leave the force, but is persuaded otherwise by Holt. Later episodes made a theme of it and it re-framed the relationship dynamics for me. When I look back I see a lot of it in my own life on both sides and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of pause recently, making some obvious decisions/commitments difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
